# Matrix-Operations

# Objective:
To develop a matrix calculator that supports operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication on square matrices. The user should be able to specify the size of the matrices and choose the desired operation.

# Project Components:
The project consists of three classes, each handling specific functionalities of the application.

# 1. Class: Matrix
Description:
This class represents a square matrix. It encapsulates the matrix data and provides methods for setting and retrieving values from the matrix. It also overrides the toString method to facilitate easy printing of matrix contents.

Responsibilities:
Store and manage matrix data.
Allow modification and retrieval of matrix elements.
Provide a string representation of the matrix for display purposes.

# 2. Class: MatrixOperations
Responsibilities:
Implement matrix addition.
Implement matrix subtraction.
Implement matrix multiplication.

# GUI class
Initialize and display the GUI components.
Handle user actions like button clicks to trigger matrix operations.
Display the results of operations within the GUI.

JFrame for the main window.
JTextField for inputting matrix sizes and values.
JButton for operations like add, subtract, and multiply.
JTextArea or JLabel for displaying results.
